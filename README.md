# Next + Leaflet

Playing around with the mapping library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) inside of Nextjs

## TODO

### Features

- [ ] Create `<Cluster />` component
- [ ] Migrate current `<Marker />` components into `<Cluster />`
- [ ] Fetch Pins from Google Maps instead of reading test file
- [ ] Create `<Popup />` component to better display data
- [ ] SVG + Color picker for custom map pins
- [ ] Whole Auth suite (create user, update user, delete user)
- [ ] Store user pins + custom colors / svgs

### Nice to have

- [ ] Clean up data extraction of Google Response (add better typing)
- [ ] Write some tests for data extraction of Google Response
- [ ] Switch svg rendering to use something dynamic (fontawesome classes maybe)
